Hey!

I'm Pouya Behzadifar, a Computer Engineering graduate from Isfahan University of Technology. My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Medical Imaging and 3D Computer Vision. I am also interested in using computer vision in robotics. However, I'm always eager to explore new frontiers in AI and continually expand my knowledge base.


Beyond academics, I enjoy playing the piano and taking relaxing walks with music.
